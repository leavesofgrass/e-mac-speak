- The following output from emacspeak causes issues.
When you send this text to the server it says nothing until you issue
   an additional d command:
---- begin ---
q {   [[rate 350]] 
 }
q {
 }
q { [[rate 350]] agility-mawson-lakes:~    [[rate 350]]  
 }
q {   [[rate 350]] 
 }
q { [[rate 350]]  pound      [[rate 350]]  
 }
d
---- end ---

- The lowercase letter  b is pronounced very strangely although the capital B is ok.  Remember some special caseing in the server which is probably already trying to deal with this.  Need to isolate when this happens, seams to be when arrowing over the letter or when typing, not when it is read as a single word in a sentence.
- Sometimes chunks of text are lost.  Haven't been able to create a reproduceable case yet.
- Sometimes the voicification goes crazy and the pitch gets all out of wack.  Resetting with c-e c-s appears to fix it.

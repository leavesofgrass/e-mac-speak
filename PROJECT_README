Welcome to E-Mac-Speak.


This project is an attempt to unify efforts around making a stable port of Emacspeak for Mac OS X.  The ultimate goal is to contribute as much upstream as possible.

Currently, we have a branch of Emacspeak TOT; there are minimal modifications to enable basic speaking.

Remaining tasks:
-  the lisp side needs some work (especially ironing out the
personalities and ranges).
-  the server side also needs some work as not all of the speech
protocol's supported yet and not all edge cases are handled.

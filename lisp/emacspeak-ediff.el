;;{{{  Introduction:

;;;Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff.  ;;;Comparing and
;;; patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the screen.
;;; ;;;This module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently
;;; ;;;with ediff. Try it out, it's an excellent example of why
;;; Emacspeak is better than a traditional screenreader.  This module
;;; was originally written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled
;;; with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier.  It has been updated to work
;;; with the newer and much larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29
;;; and later.

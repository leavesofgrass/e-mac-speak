Hi Raman,

A few words about the available customization options:

There are basically two mechanisms. They apply only to dtk-speak, not to the case where a single character is spoken:

dtk-unicode-character-replacement-alist:

This is for adding a replacement for a specific character. For example
"left double quote" is very long, thus we replace it with the ascii
quotes character. A replacement for the character at point can be
added interactively with dtk-unicode-customize-char. Here is a problem
I could not solve yet: The variable
dtk-unicode-character-replacement-alist is not saved because I do not
know how to do programmatically what the "Save for future sessions"
action of customize does.

The other replacement mechanism is the variable
dtk-unicode-name-transformation-rules-alist. It allows for things like
"greek letter lambda" to be replaced by "lambda", for all greek
letters. Also, names that end in "symbol" like "trademark symbol" have
the "symbol stripped off.

The patch has currently at least three shortcomings I would like to get fixed:

* Support for emacs 23
* Automatically save the interactively added customizations
* Respect the  emacspeak puntuation level setting

> Could you add in comments at the end of each line indicating the
> octal value?

I can do that, but maybe, the customization facility of emacs can be
used to show this information in the customization buffer
automatically.

Best regards, Lukas
